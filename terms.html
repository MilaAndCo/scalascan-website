    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="legal-date">Effective Date: February 26, 2026</p>

    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Scala mobile application ("the App") provided by Mila & Co LLC ("we," "our," or "us"). By downloading, installing, or using Scala, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using Scala, you confirm that you are at least 17 years old and agree to comply with these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the App.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Scala is a LiDAR-based room scanning application that uses your iPhone's sensors and Apple's RoomPlan framework to capture room dimensions, generate 2D floor plans, and produce measurement reports. The App is designed as a professional tool for contractors, insurance adjusters, and other professionals.</p>

    <h2>3. Measurement Accuracy Disclaimer</h2>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Measurements generated by Scala are AI-detected estimates derived from LiDAR sensor data. While we strive for accuracy, these measurements should be treated as approximations and reference values only. Scala is not a certified measurement instrument.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Always verify measurements manually before making professional, financial, or construction decisions.</li>
      <li>Accuracy may vary based on room conditions, lighting, surface materials, and device capabilities.</li>
      <li>Do not rely solely on Scala measurements for insurance claims, construction projects, real estate transactions, or any purpose where precise measurements are critical.</li>
      <li>Mila & Co LLC is not responsible for any decisions made based on Scala's measurements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Subscriptions &amp; Billing</h2>
    <p>Scala may offer optional subscription plans ("Pro") that unlock additional features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Subscriptions are billed through the Apple App Store on a recurring basis (monthly or annually).</li>
      <li>Payment is charged to your Apple ID account upon confirmation of purchase.</li>
      <li>Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.</li>
      <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription in your iPhone's Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; Subscriptions.</li>
      <li>No refunds are provided for unused portions of a subscription period. Refund requests must be directed to Apple.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to use Scala only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You shall not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the App for any illegal activity or to violate the rights of others.</li>
      <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App.</li>
      <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any portion of the App or its systems.</li>
      <li>Remove, alter, or obscure any copyright or proprietary notices.</li>
      <li>Redistribute, sublicense, or commercially exploit the App without our written consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All content, features, and functionality of Scala — including but not limited to the design, code, graphics, logos, and user interface — are the exclusive property of Mila & Co LLC and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. Your room scan data and exported reports remain your property.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Scala is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied.</li>
      <li>We do not warrant that the App will be error-free, uninterrupted, or that measurements will be accurate for any particular purpose.</li>
      <li>In no event shall Mila & Co LLC be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of your use of the App.</li>
      <li>Our total liability for any claim related to the App shall not exceed the amount you paid for the App or subscription in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Mila & Co LLC, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from your use of the App, your violation of these Terms, or your reliance on measurements provided by the App.</p>

    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to Scala at any time, with or without cause, without notice. Upon termination, all rights granted to you under these Terms will immediately cease.</p>

    <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of South Carolina, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be resolved in the courts of Horry County, South Carolina.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be reflected in the App and on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of Scala after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
