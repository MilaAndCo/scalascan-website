    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="legal-date">Effective Date: February 26, 2026</p>

    <p>Mila & Co LLC ("we," "our," or "us") operates Scala ("the App"), a LiDAR-based room scanning application for iOS. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use Scala.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>Scala is designed with privacy at its core. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to our servers. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or any other identifying information.</li>
      <li>We do not track your location using GPS or other location services.</li>
      <li>We do not use analytics, tracking pixels, or advertising frameworks.</li>
      <li>We do not create user accounts or profiles.</li>
      <li>We do not sell, share, or transfer any user data to third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Device Features &amp; Data Processing</h2>

    <h2>2a. LiDAR &amp; Room Scanning</h2>
    <p>Scala uses your device's LiDAR sensor and Apple's RoomPlan API to scan rooms. All scanning and processing occurs entirely on your device. Room scan data (dimensions, floor plans, 3D models) is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to our servers.</p>

    <h2>2b. Camera &amp; Photo Library</h2>
    <p>With your permission, Scala accesses your camera to capture photos during room scans and your photo library to attach existing images to scan reports. Photos remain on your device and within your iCloud account. We never access, upload, or process your photos on external servers.</p>

    <h2>2c. Address Autocomplete</h2>
    <p>Scala uses Apple MapKit to provide address suggestions when you enter project addresses. These requests are handled directly by Apple's services under Apple's own privacy policy. We do not intercept, store, or have access to your address searches. We do not use GPS location tracking — address entry is entirely manual and optional.</p>

    <h2>3. iCloud Sync</h2>
    <p>If you have iCloud enabled, Scala uses Apple's CloudKit to sync your scan data across your Apple devices. This data is stored in your private iCloud container, accessible only to you through your Apple ID. We cannot access your iCloud data. Apple's iCloud privacy practices apply to this stored data.</p>

    <h2>4. Subscriptions &amp; Payments</h2>
    <p>Scala offers optional in-app subscriptions managed entirely through the Apple App Store. We use RevenueCat to manage subscription status. RevenueCat receives only an anonymous identifier — never your name, email, Apple ID, or payment information. All payment processing is handled by Apple. We never see or store your payment details.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Scala integrates with the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Apple RoomPlan API</strong> — On-device room scanning (no data transmitted).</li>
      <li><strong>Apple CloudKit</strong> — Private iCloud sync (your Apple ID protects your data).</li>
      <li><strong>Apple MapKit</strong> — Address autocomplete (handled by Apple directly).</li>
      <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> — Anonymous subscription management only.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not integrate with any advertising networks, analytics platforms, or data brokers.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
    <p>All scan data, room measurements, photos, and project information are stored locally on your device and optionally in your private iCloud container. We have no servers that store your data. Because we don't collect data, there is no data to breach.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Scala is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children. Since we collect no personal data from any user, this applies universally.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the app and on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of Scala after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
